# HashiCorp Vault Setup on EC2 Auto-Scaling Group
This section automates the installation of HashiCorp Vault on EC2 instances created in the Auto-Scaling Group.

## Requirements
- Ensure the Auto-Scaling Group is created as described in Task 2


## Overview

This Terraform configuration sets up an Auto-Scaling Group in AWS with EC2 instances running HashiCorp Vault.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Terraform configurations.

2. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```sh
   terraform init


#Apply the Configuration:
terraform apply
This will create the necessary resources, including the VPC, subnets, security groups, and the Auto-Scaling Group with Vault installed on the EC2 instances.

#Access Vault:
Vault will be accessible via the public IP address of the instances on port 8200.

#Open a browser and navigate to http://<instance-public-ip>:8200.
Replace <instance-public-ip> with the actual public IP address of any EC2 instance in the Auto-Scaling Group.

Use Vault:
Follow Vault documentation to initialize and unseal Vault, and start storing and retrieving secrets.

#Notes
The Vault configuration file is located at /etc/vault.d/vault.hcl on the EC2 instances.
The Vault data is stored at /mnt/vault/data.
This setup will ensure that HashiCorp Vault is automatically installed and configured on each instance in the Auto-Scaling Group. Let me know if you need anything else!


## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>

2. Initialize Terraform:

terraform init

3.	Plan the deployment:
terraform plan

4.	Apply the deployment:
terraform apply

5.	To access Vault, SSH into one of the EC2 instances.
Assumptions
•	Vault will be installed on private instances for security reasons.
Best Practices
•	Use user_data for automated installations.
•	Regularly update to the latest version of Vault for security enhancements.









### Final Steps

1. **Commit the Code**: Make sure to commit all files to your Git repository.
2. **Review and Test**: Before submission, test the Terraform code to ensure it works as expected.
3. **Prepare for Interview**: Be ready to explain your choices and the structure of your code, focusing on best practices and security.
